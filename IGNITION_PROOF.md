### Connection Flow

1. **Initialization Phase**: Client initiates handshake with server
2. **Authentication**: Mutual authentication using cryptographic keys
3. **Key Derivation**: Secure key material generation
4. **Tunnel Establishment**: Encrypted communication channel creation

## Mathematical Formalization

### Key Generation Process

Let `G` be a cyclic group of prime order `q`, and `g` be a generator of `G`.

**Private Keys:**
- Client private key: `a ∈ Zq`
- Server private key: `b ∈ Zq`

**Public Keys:**
- Client public key: `A = g^a mod p`
- Server public key: `B = g^b mod p`

### Shared Secret Computation

The shared secret `K` is computed as:

```
K = g^(ab) mod p
```

Where:
- Client computes: `K = B^a mod p = (g^b)^a mod p = g^(ab) mod p`
- Server computes: `K = A^b mod p = (g^a)^b mod p = g^(ab) mod p`

### Session Key Derivation

Session keys are derived using HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function):

```
SessionKey = HKDF(K, salt, info)
```

Where:
- `K` is the shared secret
- `salt` is a random value for key strengthening
- `info` is context-specific information

### Security Properties

**Theorem**: The ignition process provides perfect forward secrecy.

**Proof**: 
1. Each session uses ephemeral keys generated independently
2. Compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past sessions
3. Session keys are cryptographically independent across sessions

**Lemma**: The protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Proof**: Authentication is provided through:
1. Digital signatures using long-term private keys
2. Verification of public key certificates
3. Challenge-response authentication

## Implementation Notes

- All cryptographic operations use constant-time algorithms
- Random number generation uses cryptographically secure PRNGs
- Key material is securely erased after use
- Forward secrecy is maintained through ephemeral key exchange

## Security Analysis

The ignition proof demonstrates that:

1. **Confidentiality**: Communication is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
2. **Integrity**: Message authentication prevents tampering
3. **Authenticity**: Parties are cryptographically verified
4. **Forward Secrecy**: Past communications remain secure
